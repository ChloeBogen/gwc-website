#Seattle Central Girls Who Code Website Project
#For now, I'd like to have a what is GWC section, who are we section, and QR code link to: https://hq.girlswhocode.com/home to sign up on the official HQ page. 
They will also need to have this code: 'CL60804' to sign up. It would also be be nice to have a QR code link to our discord. I will work on writing the
information for the two sections. I've added their logos and design guide to the repo, we generally just have to be mindful of the fonts/colors.
